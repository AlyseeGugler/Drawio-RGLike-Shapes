# Shape Libraries for Diagrams.net
This project provides shape libraries for diagrams.net (formerly known as draw.io) inspired by the illustrations of the famous website [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru). Currently, the project only contains shape libraries for class and use case diagrams, but more UML shapes with this style will be added in the future.

## Getting Started
To use these shape libraries in diagrams.net, follow these steps:

1. Download the XML file(s) for the desired shape library from the "Shapes" folder in this repository.
2. In diagrams.net, click on "File" > "Open Library" > "From Device".
3. Select the downloaded XML file and click "Open".
4. The shapes in the library should now be available in the "Libraries" section of the left-hand sidebar in diagrams.net.

## Examples
Here are some examples created using the shape libraries in this project:
### Class Diagram
#### Singleton
This example is based on the [Singleton Example](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton) from [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru)

#### Iterator
This example is based on the [Iterator Example](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator) from [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru)

### Use Case Diagram
#### Airport Check-In Example
This example is based on the [Airport Check-In Example](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/airport-checkin-uml-use-case-diagram-example.html) from [uml-diagrams.org](https://uml-diagrams.org).
