# Shape Libraries for Diagrams.net
This project provides shape libraries for diagrams.net (formerly known as draw.io) inspired by the illustrations of the famous website refactoring.guru. Currently, the project only contains shape libraries for class diagrams, but more UML shapes with this style will be added in the future.

## Getting Started
To use these shape libraries in diagrams.net, follow these steps:

1. Download the XML file(s) for the desired shape library from the "Shapes" folder in this repository.
2. In diagrams.net, click on "File" > "Open Library" > "From Device".
3. Select the downloaded XML file and click "Open".
4. The shapes in the library should now be available in the "Libraries" section of the left-hand sidebar in diagrams.net.

## Examples
Here are some examples of class diagrams created using the shape libraries in this project:
